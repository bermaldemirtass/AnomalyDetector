# AnomalyDetector-AI

This is a simple machine learning project that uses Isolation Forest to detect anomalies in numerical datasets.

## How it works

- Loads a CSV file with numerical data.
- Applies the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect outliers.
- Saves the results in a new CSV file with an added `anomaly` column.

## Files

- `anomaly_detector.py`: Main script that performs anomaly detection.
- `sample_input.csv`: Example input dataset.
- `sample_output.csv`: Output with anomaly labels.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
